# 📜 Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification Website

##  Overview

This project is a **blockchain-powered web application** for issuing and verifying academic, training, or professional certificates. By leveraging blockchain’s **immutability, transparency, and decentralization**, the platform ensures certificates cannot be forged, tampered with, or duplicated.

Institutions can **issue digital certificates**, while employers, universities, or other stakeholders can **verify their authenticity in real time** through the platform.

---

## ✨ Features

*  **Blockchain-backed verification** – Immutable records ensure trust and authenticity.
*  **Institution dashboard** – Issue and manage digital certificates.
*  **Student profile** – View and share certificates securely.
*  **Verifier portal** – Quickly verify certificates using certificate ID or QR code.
*  **Smart contracts** – Secure issuance and storage of certificate data.
*  **QR code integration** – Easy verification via scan.
*  **Web-based interface** – Simple, user-friendly UI for all stakeholders.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js / Next.js, TailwindCSS
* **Backend**: Node.js / Express.js
* **Blockchain**: Ethereum / Polygon (Solidity Smart Contracts, Hardhat/Truffle)
* **Database**: IPFS (for decentralized storage) + MongoDB/PostgreSQL (for metadata)
* **Authentication**: MetaMask / WalletConnect integration
* **Other Tools**: QR Code Generator, Web3.js / Ethers.js

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Institution Issues Certificate**

   * Uploads student details + certificate data.
   * Smart contract generates a unique hash stored on blockchain.
2. **Student Receives Certificate**

   * Certificate available in dashboard.
   * Can download/share a QR-enabled version.
3. **Verifier Checks Certificate**

   * Scans QR code or enters certificate ID.
   * System verifies details against blockchain hash.
